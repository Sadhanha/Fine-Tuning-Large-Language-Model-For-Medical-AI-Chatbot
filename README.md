# Large-Language-Models

## Overview

This repository contains models fine-tuned with instruction-based techniques to enhance their ability to understand and generate domain-specific content. Leveraging explicit instructions, the training process focuses on aligning model outputs with specific task objectives, resulting in models that are not only more efficient but also significantly more accurate in interpreting complex instructions and producing relevant responses. This approach has proven to revolutionize the training and application of machine learning models, demonstrating substantial improvements in handling nuanced tasks across various domains.
